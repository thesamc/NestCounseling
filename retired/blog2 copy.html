            <h2>Grief During the Holidays</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
              By megan | December 4, 2024 | Uncategorized
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                Grief during the holidays isn’t just about sadness. Sure, there
                might be tears when a favorite song plays or when you pull out
                that one ornament. But grief can also look like anger when
                someone says the wrong thing or a deep ache when everyone else
                seems so joyful. Sometimes it’s just plain exhaustion from
                pretending you’re okay when you’re not.
              </p>
              <p>
                And then there’s the grief we don’t always talk about. The
                messy, complicated feelings that don’t fit into the neat picture
                of loss people expect. Maybe you’re mourning someone who isn’t
                physically gone but emotionally unavailable—a parent who’s still
                alive but was never really “there” for you. That’s called
                ambiguous grief, and it’s heavy in a way that’s hard to explain.
                Or maybe your loss doesn’t feel “valid” enough, like a
                miscarriage, the loss of a pet, or a dream that didn’t happen.
                That’s disenfranchised grief, and it often comes with a side of
                guilt for even feeling the way you do.
              </p>

              <p>
                The holidays can bring all of this to the surface, magnifying
                what’s missing or what could have been. You might find yourself
                smiling through traditions while a part of you feels distant and
                detached. You might avoid gatherings altogether because the
                weight of pretending is too much.
              </p>

              <p>
                But Grief doesn’t follow a timeline and it doesn’t have to look
                a certain way. You’re allowed to feel joy and sadness in the
                same breath. You’re allowed to take up space with your grief,
                even if the world around you feels like it’s shouting, “Be
                happy!”
              </p>

              <p>
                If this resonates, know that you don’t have to navigate it
                alone. Therapy can help you make sense of the layers of grief,
                find ways to honor your loss, and let go of the pressure to “get
                over it.” The holidays may never feel the same, but they can
                still hold moments of peace and connection—even if it looks
                different than it did before. You deserve that, and we’re here
                to support you.

            <h2>Parenting After Childhood Trauma</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
              By megan | November 16, 2024 | Uncategorized
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                Parenting is never easy, but when you’ve experienced childhood
                trauma, it can feel like navigating a minefield of emotional
                triggers. You might find yourself reacting in ways that surprise
                even you—feeling disproportionately angry, shutting down, or
                becoming hypervigilant about your child’s safety. Your past has
                shaped you, and when parenting stirs up old wounds, it can feel
                overwhelming.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the hardest parts of parenting after trauma is when your
                child reminds you of yourself at the age you were hurt. Looking
                at your child, so innocent and full of trust, can bring a fresh
                wave of pain. It’s heartbreaking to think about someone hurting
                a child—or to recognize that you weren’t protected in the way
                your child deserves to be. These moments can leave you feeling
                raw, questioning your own emotions and the love you deserved as
                a child.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many, this leads to avoidance. Avoidance can look like
                overcompensating by trying to be the “perfect” parent or
                distancing yourself emotionally to protect your heart. While
                this might feel like self-preservation, avoidance can limit your
                ability to fully connect with your child and create moments of
                emotional distance.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re hypervigilant, you may find yourself on edge,
                constantly scanning for danger. This heightened state of anxiety
                can drain your energy and leave you feeling irritable or
                exhausted. You’re not just trying to keep your child safe—you’re
                working overtime to soothe your own inner fears.˝
              </p>
              <p>
                The good news is that you don’t have to parent in the shadow of
                your trauma forever. Therapy can help you process these emotions
                and triggers, unpack the pain of your past, and build tools for
                more mindful, connected parenting. Together, we can work to heal
                those old wounds while giving you the support and guidance you
                need to thrive as both a parent and an individual. You deserve
                peace—and so does your child.

            <h2>Postpartum Depression: Beyond the Baby Blues</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
              By megan | October 31, 2024 | Uncategorized
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                After giving birth, it’s natural to experience a mix of
                emotions—joy, exhaustion, and sometimes even sadness. For many
                new mothers, these mood swings are part of the “baby blues,” a
                temporary adjustment period in the first two weeks postpartum.
                The baby blues often involve mild mood changes, tearfulness, and
                feelings of overwhelm, but they typically ease on their own.
                Postpartum Depression (PPD) is different. Affecting roughly 1 in
                8 mothers, PPD lasts longer and has more intense symptoms than
                the baby blues. PPD may cause deep feelings of sadness,
                disconnection, or irritability. Many mothers also struggle with
                fatigue that isn’t relieved by sleep, difficulty concentrating,
                or feeling as though they’re failing as a parent. These feelings
                can impact daily life, making it hard to bond with your baby,
                communicate with loved ones, or focus on work and personal
                responsibilities. You may find yourself avoiding friends and
                family or feeling constant guilt that makes it difficult to
                enjoy time with your baby.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s important to remember that PPD is not your fault. Various
                factors, including a personal or family history of depression or
                anxiety, limited support, a traumatic birth experience, and
                hormonal changes, can all increase the risk of PPD. The good
                news is that with help, PPD is manageable. Therapy, particularly
                with a perinatal-trained therapist, can be transformative in
                navigating these challenges. At Nest Counseling, we specialize
                in supporting new mothers through these transitions, offering a
                safe space to address these experiences. If you’re struggling,
                reach out—healing is possible, and you don’t have to face this
                journey alone.

            <h2>Therapy for Therapists</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">

              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                As therapists, we know the value of mental health care—but when
                it comes to seeking help ourselves, shame can creep in. Many of
                us feel we should be able to manage our struggles on our own,
                and admitting we need support can trigger feelings of failure.
                But therapists are human, too. We face our own challenges,
                including burnout, vicarious trauma, stress, and unresolved
                childhood issues. One of the hardest parts of stepping into
                therapy as a therapist is taking off our “therapist hat” and
                allowing ourselves to be the client. We may struggle to stop
                analyzing the process and simply be present with our own pain.
                Add to that the difficulty of finding a therapist outside our
                professional network, and it’s no wonder many therapists
                hesitate to get the help they deserve. But just like our
                clients, we need a safe space to process our emotions and
                decompress from the weight of the work we do. Therapy for
                therapists isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a radical act of
                self-care. Let’s normalize getting the help we need, because
                we’re all worthy of support.
              </p>
              <p>
                The truth is, therapists are often at higher risk for mental
                health struggles due to the nature of our work. We hold space
                for others’ pain, and that can lead to compassion fatigue,
                exhaustion, and even personal crises. Seeking therapy gives us a
                chance to refill our own cups, heal our own wounds, and prevent
                the burnout that is so prevalent in our field. You deserve care
                and support- NOT so that you can be better at helping others,
                but because YOU are a person and you deserve it. At Nest
                Counseling, we focus on helping the helpers and that includes
                therapy for therapists. Email us if you want to see if we can be
                a good fit.

              Healing from Sexual Assult: Support is Available When You're Ready
            </h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">

              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                Experiencing sexual assault is a deeply painful and traumatic
                event. It can affect your body, mind, and emotions in ways you
                might not even realize. Trauma from assault can show up in many
                forms—nightmares, anxiety, difficulty trusting others, or even
                physical symptoms like chronic pain or tension. Shame often
                accompanies this trauma, and reaching out for help can feel
                overwhelming. But you don’t have to go through it alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Nest Counseling, we are trained in trauma-informed care and
                specialize in helping survivors of sexual assault. We use
                approaches like somatic therapy and EMDR (Eye Movement
                Desensitization and Reprocessing) to gently guide you through
                the healing process. Somatic therapy helps you reconnect with
                your body, releasing the trauma that gets stored in it, while
                EMDR can allow you to process traumatic memories without needing
                to recount every detail. This can be especially helpful if
                revisiting those moments feels too difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know that accessing therapy can feel like another hurdle,
                which is why Pennsylvania’s Victims Compensation Assistance
                Program is available to help cover up to $5,000 for therapy
                ($10,000 if the crime occurred when you were a child).
                Importantly, you don’t have to have reported the assault to the
                police to qualify for this support, but the crime must have
                occurred in Pennsylvania.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therapy can be a safe space to process what happened at your own
                pace. Whether you’re dealing with flashbacks, shame, or
                numbness, we’re here to help you feel heard and supported. Our
                team is compassionate, experienced, and focused on helping you
                heal.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you decide to begin counseling, you may start to feel more
                connected to yourself and your body, find relief from
                overwhelming emotions, and begin to reclaim your sense of safety
                and control. Healing is possible, and taking that first step can
                lead to profound positive change.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are not alone, and when you’re ready, we’re here to support
                you. Reach out today to begin your journey toward healing.

            <h2>Birth Trauma</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
              By megan | September 4, 2024 | Trauma Therapy
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                Birth is supposed to be one of the most transformative moments
                of your life—but what if it didn’t go the way you hoped? What if
                you’re left feeling shaken, scared, or haunted by what happened?
                This is the reality of birth trauma, and you’re far from alone.
                Studies show that up to 45% of women report their birth as
                traumatic, and 1 in 3 experience some form of PTSD symptoms
                after childbirth. That’s a huge number of parents out there
                quietly carrying the weight of a birth that didn’t go as
                planned, feeling like they should just “move on” when it’s
                anything but simple. If that’s you, please know that your
                feelings are real, valid, and worth talking about.
              </p>
              <h2>What is birth trauma?</h2>
              <p>
                Birth trauma isn’t just about what happened during your
                delivery—it’s about how it left you feeling. It might have been
                a sudden emergency, a loss of control, feeling dismissed by your
                care team, or pain that felt out of control. Birth trauma can
                look like tears that come without warning, panic at the thought
                of another birth, or feeling like your body betrayed you. If
                your birth experience left you feeling more than just
                disappointed, if it feels like a wound that hasn’t healed, you
                might be dealing with birth trauma. And it’s not just in your
                head—it’s a real psychological impact that can affect your
                day-to-day life,
              </p>
              <h2>Signs of Birth Trauma and Postpartum PTSD</h2>
              <p>Birth trauma can show up in many ways. You might notice:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Recurrent thoughts or nightmares about the birth</li>
                <li>
                  Flashbacks or feeling like you’re reliving the experience
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hypervigilance, especially around your baby’s health or safety
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoidance of reminders like hospitals, birth stories, or even
                  your own medical records
                </li>
                <li>
                  Emotional numbness or feeling disconnected from your baby or
                  yourself
                </li>
                <li>
                  Intense feelings of guilt, shame, or anger over how things
                  went
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If any of this hits home, you’re not alone—and you’re not
                overreacting.
              </p>
              <h2>How EMDR Can Help You Heal from Birth Trauma</h2>
              <p>
                One of the most effective therapies for birth trauma is EMDR, or
                Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. EMDR isn’t your
                typical talk therapy. It’s a powerful approach that helps your
                brain process and heal from trauma in a way that doesn’t require
                you to constantly relive the painful details.
              </p>
              <p>Here’s how EMDR can help you heal:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Processing Traumatic Memories: EMDR helps your brain reprocess
                  traumatic memories so they feel less raw, painful, and
                  overwhelming. You don’t have to go through every gory detail;
                  EMDR works by guiding your brain to naturally heal and file
                  those memories away in a way that feels more manageable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reducing Triggers and Flashbacks: If you’ve been avoiding
                  certain places, people, or even conversations about birth
                  because they bring you right back to that moment, EMDR can
                  help desensitize those triggers, making it easier to navigate
                  your everyday life without the constant fear of being pulled
                  back into the trauma.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reconnecting with Your Body: After birth trauma, it’s common
                  to feel disconnected or distrustful of your own body. EMDR
                  helps you rebuild that trust by processing the experience in a
                  way that brings compassion and understanding back into the
                  picture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reclaiming Your Birth Story: Trauma often leaves us feeling
                  powerless. EMDR can help you reframe your birth story, giving
                  you back a sense of control and empowerment over what
                  happened. It’s not about forgetting—it’s about finding a way
                  to move forward without the weight of those memories pulling
                  you down.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>You Don’t Have to Do This Alone</h2>
              <p>
                Birth trauma is real, and healing is possible. You deserve to
                feel seen, heard, and supported as you work through this
                experience. EMDR is just one of the ways we can help you find
                peace and reclaim your story. You don’t have to keep carrying
                this alone—let’s work together to help you feel whole again.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re ready to take that first step, reach out. Let’s talk
                about how EMDR and other therapeutic supports can help you start
                healing today.

            <h2>The Invisible Weight of Special Needs Parenting</h2>
            <div class="blog-meta">
              By megan | August 26, 2024 | Caregivers & Helpers
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p class="blog-excerpt">
                Parenting is hard—full stop. But when you’re a parent to a child
                with special needs, “hard” doesn’t even begin to cover it. It’s
                like carrying a weight that’s not just heavy but invisible. The
                kind of weight that makes you feel like you’re trudging through
                quicksand, while everyone around you seems to be walking on
                solid ground. For those of us in that 25-45 age bracket, where
                the world expects us to have it all figured out, raising a child
                with special needs adds a layer of stress that most can’t even
                begin to understand. It’s the mental load that’s not just about
                getting through the day but about navigating a labyrinth of
                therapies, doctor appointments, and endless forms—all while
                trying to be the best parent, partner, and person you can be.
              </p>
              <h2>The Unseen Strain on Mental Health</h2>
              <p>
                Let’s be real: the impact on our mental health is profound.
                There’s the constant anxiety—about the future, about whether
                you’re doing enough, about what happens when you can’t do it
                anymore. It’s the kind of anxiety that doesn’t go away when the
                baby starts sleeping through the night or when the school year
                begins. It’s relentless. There’s also the guilt. The gnawing
                feeling that maybe you could have done something differently or
                that you’re somehow not enough. The guilt when you’re exhausted
                and just need a break but know that there’s no real break from
                this. The guilt when you look at other families and wonder why
                this happened to yours. And let’s not even get started on the
                guilt of feeling angry or resentful—feelings that are entirely
                normal but feel so taboo. Then there’s the isolation. Even if
                you’re surrounded by people, it can feel like no one truly gets
                it. The well-meaning advice from friends or family who say
                things like, “I don’t know how you do it” or “You’re so strong,”
                can feel like nails on a chalkboard. Because the truth is,
                you’re not doing it because you’re strong. You’re doing it
                because you have to, because this is your life now. And
                sometimes, you just want someone to sit with you in the mess of
                it all and say, “This sucks, and it’s okay to say it.”
              </p>
              <h2>The Emotional Rollercoaster</h2>
              <p>
                The emotional toll is staggering. One minute, you’re marveling
                at your child’s resilience, their ability to find joy in the
                little things, and the next, you’re overwhelmed by grief. Grief
                for the life you thought you’d have, for the things your child
                might never experience, for the never-ending battle against a
                world that isn’t built for them. And there’s anger—anger at the
                universe, at the system that makes everything so much harder
                than it needs to be, at the people who stare or judge or say the
                wrong thing. It’s an anger that simmers beneath the surface,
                sometimes bubbling over in ways you wish it didn’t, but it’s
                there. And it’s exhausting.
              </p>
              <h2>The Silent Struggle</h2>
              <p>
                This isn’t the life you imagined. And while you wouldn’t trade
                your child for anything, it’s okay to admit that this life is
                harder than you ever thought possible. It’s okay to say that
                some days, you feel like you’re barely holding it together.
                Because the truth is, special needs parenting is a marathon with
                no finish line. It’s a journey that’s as beautiful as it is
                brutal, as rewarding as it is relentless. So if you’re feeling
                stressed, overwhelmed, or like no one understands—know that
                you’re not alone in this. Your feelings are valid, and your
                struggle is real, even if it sometimes feels like the world is
                oblivious to the weight you’re carrying. At Nest Counseling, we
                understand the stress of special needs parenting. We provide
                accessible online counseling to fit in your own self care within
                the constraints of your care-giving responsibilities. Email

              <p>
                Working in healthcare is one of the most rewarding professions,
                but it’s no secret that it comes with significant stress.
                Whether you’re a doctor, nurse, therapist, or other healthcare
                professional, the demands of caring for others can take a toll
                on your mental and physical well-being. In a field where you’re
                expected to be strong and resilient, it’s easy to forget that
                you, too, need care and support.

                Healthcare professionals face a range of unique stressors that
                can lead to burnout, anxiety, and even depression. These
                challenges include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Long Hours and Shift Work: The demanding schedules and

                  making it harder to cope with daily stress.

                  decisions can create immense mental strain, especially when
                  time is of the essence.

                  Emotional Toll: Regular exposure to illness, trauma, and death
                  can lead to vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, and

                  Administrative Pressures: Navigating the bureaucratic side of
                  healthcare—paperwork, insurance issues, and regulatory
                  demands—adds another layer of stress that can detract from

                  Work-Life Imbalance: The commitment to patients often means

              <h2>Recognizing the Signs of Stress</h2>
              <p>
                Understanding the signs of stress is the first step toward
                managing it effectively. Common symptoms among healthcare
                professionals include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Physical Symptoms: Headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, and
                  gastrointestinal issues are all common physical manifestations
                  of stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Emotional Symptoms: Feelings of irritability, sadness, or
                  being overwhelmed can indicate that stress levels are becoming
                  unmanageable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cognitive Symptoms: Difficulty concentrating, brain fog and
                  memory issues can be symptoms of burnout
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apathy: When burnout gets severe, healthcare workers can start
                  to feel jaded, apathetic and lose their sense of compassion
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hopelessness: A sense of hopelessness and no longer caring
                  about the future can be one of the worst symptoms of stress
                  and burnout
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When healthcare workers are not given proper support and are
                existing in a work environment which does not value their
                contributions, it can lead to burnout that has you dreaming
                about quitting and working at a coffee shop instead. Our
                licensed therapists can help. At Nest Counseling, we specialize

                Welcoming a new baby is an exciting adventure, but it can also
                be really scary. Postpartum anxiety is a common experience that
                affects many new parents, and it’s important to address it with
                care and understanding. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, know that
                you’re not alone, and there are effective ways to find balance
                and support.
              </p>
              <h2>What is Postpartum Anxiety?</h2>
              <p>
                Postpartum anxiety is more than just occasional worries about
                your baby’s well-being. It involves intense, persistent anxiety
                that can interfere with daily life. Common symptoms include
                excessive worry about your baby’s health, feeling overwhelmed by
                parenting responsibilities, physical symptoms like rapid
                heartbeat or sweating, and having difficulty relaxing or
                sleeping.
              </p>
              <h2>Why Does Postpartum Anxiety Happen?</h2>
              <p>
                Postpartum anxiety can stem from a combination of hormonal
                changes, the stress of adjusting to a new baby, sleep
                deprivation, and a shift in your identity and responsibilities.
                It’s a complex mix of physical, emotional, and environmental
                factors that can impact any new parent, regardless of how
                prepared they feel. While most new parents have some worries,
                postpartum anxiety is intense, constant worries that impact all
                areas of your life. It can impact your sleep, your
                relationships, your physical health and your ability to work and
                parent.
              </p>
              <h2>Recognizing the Signs</h2>
              <p>
                Understanding the signs of postpartum anxiety can help you seek
                support early. Some common indicators include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Constant Worry: Feeling an overwhelming sense of worry or
                  dread about your baby’s health or your ability to care for
                  them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Physical Symptoms: Experiencing rapid heartbeat, muscle
                  tension, or excessive sweating without a clear cause.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sleep Disturbances: Struggling with insomnia or disrupted
                  sleep, even when your baby is sleeping.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Difficulty Relaxing: Finding it hard to unwind or relax, even
                  when you have time to yourself.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Effective Strategies for Managing Postpartum Anxiety</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Talk About It: Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend,
                  family member, or therapist can provide relief and
                  perspective. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of
                  strength, not weakness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prioritize yourself: Prioritizing yourself after having a baby
                  can seem impossible, but can support your wellbeing. This
                  might include taking short breaks, enjoying a hobby, or simply
                  taking a few minutes to facetime a friend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set Realistic Expectations: Adjusting to life with a new baby
                  takes time. It’s okay to set small, manageable goals and
                  acknowledge your achievements, no matter how minor they may
                  seem.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Seek Professional Help: If your anxiety feels overwhelming or
                  persistent, a mental health professional can offer support
                  through therapy and, if necessary, medication.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Join a Support Group: Connecting with other new parents who
                  are experiencing similar feelings can provide comfort and
                  practical advice. Many communities and online platforms offer
                  support groups specifically for postpartum anxiety. Postpartum
                  Support International offers online, free support groups.
                </li>
              </ol>
